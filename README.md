# UI Component Collections

This repository contains various UI components built with Tailwind CSS. The components are grouped into categories such as Motion, UI, and Shared components. Each component is accompanied by a demo page and a code snippet that can be easily copied and pasted into your project.

The UI components are designed to be reusable and easily customizable. They are built using Tailwind's utility-first approach, which means that they are highly customizable and can be easily styled to fit your project's design.

The Motion components are built using Framer Motion, which allows for smooth and performant animations. 

All components are built using React and are designed to be used across multiple pages and projects.

# Prototypes of Web Apps

These prototypes are not full production apps with backend logic, but are fully functional in the front end, built to demonstrate core user flows, visual design, and interactive feel.

These prototypes serve as a design and development playground, showcasing how modern front-end tools like Tailwind for styling, CSS for foundational animations, and Framer Motion for advanced gestures to create compelling, interactive user interfaces before full scale development.
